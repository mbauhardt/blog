## Iris default QUERTY layout

On february I started to use my Iris keyboard ordered from
[keeb.io](http://www.keeb.io).

I used the default layout in the first few days, but I didn't typed well
or in other words I didn't feel good with it. E.g. enter is there where
I'm used to use space. The navigation is completely on on other places
where I want to have it.

For that reason I changed the default layout and moved the keys around
to a layout which feels hopefully a bit better.
