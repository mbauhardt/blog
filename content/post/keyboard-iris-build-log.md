Last year I started to type with a mechanical keyboard.
I bought a [Vortex
Core](http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&kind2=224&kind3=&kind4=1033).
This keyboard was quite impressive for me because this
keyboard is a mechanical one, I can program it and the
size is small (40%).

After some time I recognized, the programming mode is not
convenient enough for me. There is no way to program my
vortex core based on a config file. I have to press some
keystrokes to reorder my keys.

In addition to the programming mode I tried to learn to
use my 10 fingers instead my own 5.75 finger
system. But I had the feeling the staggered layout is not
the right one for me.

A colleague of mine point me to his keyboard. [Planck
Keyboard](https://olkb.com/planck), a tiny programmable
ortholinear keyboard. I wanted to buy me the same
keyboard. But in addition to this I wanted to go one step
further. I thought a splittable keyboard is more
healthier for me because I can use it with straight arms.

An [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard was quite interresting.
But somehow the [Iris from
keeb.io](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard?variant=8034004860958)
was more impressive.

So I decided to buy an iris keyboard. Inclusive stainless steel plate,
an acrylic middle layer clear and tented, cherry-mx switches clear.

Start to solder the diodes and the arduino Pro Micro.
Using kapton tape on top of trrs jack's and the Pro Micro because i'm
using a stainess steel case.

I bought some retro style keycaps with an OEM profile.
